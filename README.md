Sharedlists
===========

Sharedlists is a simple rails driven database for managing multiple product lists of various suppliers.

This app is used in conjunction with [foodsoft](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft).

Import of spreadsheets (ods, sxc, xls, xlsx) is supported when OpenOffice.org
is installed (`libreoffice` in `PATH`).
